# Getting Started with Create React App

Project WTWR

- This application is a fullstack weather web application that allows users to register with an avatar and log into the account created. Users may add clothes with a name image and weather type of the clothing. the application finds clothes and displays them depending on the weather at the users current location. furthermore, you can like/favorite you preffered clothes that have been added. in the end, if you decide that you dont want a certain article you can delete it.

Technologies and Techniques used:

React Library and JSX

State Management

- React State and Context API
- Utilized useState and useEffect
- Context for weather is used from OpenWeatherApi

Routing

-React Router v6 for handling naviation between pages seemlesly making the application appear to be single-page like with dynamic content. furthermore, authentication allows users to be routed to profile page when successfully logged in

Styling

-Css modules for all class and animation

User Authentication

-Backend authentication allows users to safely operate web app without needing to worry about element security.

Back-end

-ode.js and Express: Constructs the backend server to handle API requests, user authentication, and data storage.
-MongoDB: Stores user data, including profiles, authentication details, and clothing articles

**This project is used with the back-end server**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm dev`

Runs back-end application. /
https://github.com/Marcelluki/se_project_express.git

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
